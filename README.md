# Portfolio

Thank you for viewing my portfolio! Below you’ll find a brief summary of each project, and a shortlist of technologies used within them.
## Twitter Sentiment Analysis Engine
I developed a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to predict Twitter sentiment. The data was streamed directly into a Postgres database leveraging the Twitter API. Using advanced NLP techniques such as Word2Vec and TF-IDF vectorization, I compared different approaches to data cleaning and the impacts on predictive modeling. The final Neural Network was built using PyTorch. All coding was performed on Google Colaboratory running on a Google cloud compute GPU.

## Predicting Shirt Size
I fitted and evaluated many supervised regression models using heavily correlated body measurements to predict chest circumference. I labeled the data with a categorical shirt size variable, constructed using criteria scraped from Nike’s website. These labels allowed me to perform data clustering using the T-SNE algorithm and visualize the relative similarity of the data and how the clustered. 

## Examining Consumer Recommendations 
I performed natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction on an ecommerce clothing reviews dataset. The data was evaluated using K-Means, T-SNE, Spectral clustering, and a few other algorithms. I compared performance of binary classification models predicting consumer recommendation.
