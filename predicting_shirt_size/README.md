# Predicting Shirt Size
I fitted and evaluated many supervised regression models using heavily correlated body measurements to predict chest circumference. I labeled the data with a categorical shirt size variable, constructed using criteria scraped from Nike’s website. These labels allowed me to perform data clustering using the T-SNE algorithm and visualize the relative similarity of the data and how it clustered.

## Project background
I was interested in using regression to predict chest circumference, a common measure of shirt size. To do this I used only anthropometric variables from a comingled data set. As an added challenge I scraped sizing guidelines from the Nike retail site and created categorical shirt sizes. I then used these new variables to color a T-SNE cluster plot and demonstrate the clustering of the data by both gender and categorical size.
