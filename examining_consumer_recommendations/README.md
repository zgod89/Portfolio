# Examining Consumer Recommendations
I performed natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction on an ecommerce clothing reviews dataset. The data was evaluated using K-Means, T-SNE, Spectral clustering, and a few other algorithms. I compared performance of binary classification models predicting consumer recommendation.

## Project background
I was interested in classifying reviews relative to whether they lead to a product recommendation, using only natural language processing on the review text. 
## Data Files
1.	Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews.csv contains the original data. Data set is a mix of text, categorical, and continuous variables. 
2.	Dress.png is a file needed for the word cloud stencil to function.  
## Notebooks
