# Umpqua Bank Work Samples
Included are select project samples from Umpqua Bank, highlighting my proficiency in R. Other key skills demonstrated are data wrangling, ETL, EDA, process automation, and error testing.

## Project backgrounds
1.	NRD_Final_2020.1.21_PIISafe. 
	a.	Project was to replicate a manual reporting process using our EDW rather than the outdated legacy Marketing Software. Population recreation was done to a total error rate of < 0.5%, and resulted in time savings of 27 hours per month.
2.	RAF_Full_Report_PIISafe. 
	a.	Project was to generate a report of customers that opened an account under a specific regional promotion, including indicators for whether or not key qualifications were met.
3.	ReferAFriendMonth1_PIISafe. 
	a.	This code generates payout information for a regional promotion.
4.	ReferAFriendMonth2-5_PIISafe. 
	a.	This code generates payout information for a regional promotion during subsequent months, and includes an exclusionary check for previously paid referred friends and a running tally for referrers.
5.	xref_table_ETL_Final_PIISafe. 
	a.	This code ingests a poorly formatted Excel spreadsheet, where column headers only exist on the first tab and the data is spread across a variable number or tabs. The data is extracted and transformed into one data table, and written to a SQL Server Database.
